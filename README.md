<h1> My Portfolio</h1>


<p>This is my portfolio. I created it to display my skills as a developer and to use it in future interviews for full stack web development jobs. It has information on how to contact me as well as links to my work. I have learned to create flexboxes and how to align them within another flex box. I also learned how to resize images and to scale my project for smaller screens</p>
